# Given a hotel I am interested in and the comments, how should I anticipate my
visit?
When planning for a trip, selecting a hotel is extremely challenging due to the number of hotels
available and the amount of relevant information to compare. With so many factors hidden in the text of
written reviews and hundreds or thousands of reviews per hotel, it is unrealistic to expect a user to be
able to make a truly educated decision about their hotel choice. Since the specific amenities, services,
and locations offered by a hotel are often important to the quality of a trip, it is highly important for the
user to be able to access this information in a format which allows them to select the ideal hotel with
minimal effort to improve the likelihood of a successful trip and minimize stress and planning fatigue.
For hotels, customer reviews matter, as it brings customer loyalty, which will improve sales of hotels as
well. For this reason, hotels should observe reviews given by customers.
Due to the value of customer reviews to both customer and hotel, customer reviews have become a
great research topic in all industries including the hotel industry. Also, for researchers like us, we get a
dataset where we can do different analyses on text data (in this case it is reviews) like sentiment
analysis observing sentiments of the customers while writing reviews. Proposing a recommendation
system which tourists can use to anticipate their visit and selecting the best hotel for them.
